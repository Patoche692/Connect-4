# Connect-4
Connect 4 console game written in C with a powerful bot using recursive min-max algorithm and more optimizations.

The game board is encoded into 64 bits binary variables : each play is computed with binary operations for more efficiency.

At a certain point in the game, the bot is able to tell you if you can win or if you will inevitably loose.
